## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Caeson Reckling. I am a student at BYUI studying Computer Science. I am looking to build 
my technical skills in gernal programming, embedded systems, machine learning, and computer architecture.

My current technologies include C#, Python, C, C++
My mircocontroller experience is with the STM 32 L476RG and the arduino.

My projects include: 
- A character sheet creator for DND using C# class design.
- A camera that you can point at a sheet of music and have it read that music.
- Some robot behavior simulation projects.
- Some physics simulation environments from my past as a physics major.
